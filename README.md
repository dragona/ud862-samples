# Android project sample -  August 2019 
```from ud862-samples - ud862 - Android Design for Developers.```

This project is my updated version of the ud862 project released by the Udacity team.
While going through the course content, most of the projects were broken due to deprecations, etc.
In this repos, you should be up and running in no time if you ever need to use them.
